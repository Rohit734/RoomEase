# Product Requirements Document: RoomEase

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- To generate revenue from both tenant platform fees and owner subscription models.
- To achieve initial market penetration and establish RoomEase as the primary room search and listing platform in Sikkim.
- To build and maintain user trust and reliability for both owners and tenants.
- To replace traditional, time-consuming physical room search and manual listing methods with an efficient digital solution.
- To strategically expand operations to cover all states in India following successful validation in Sikkim.

### Background Context

RoomEase addresses the significant inefficiencies and frustrations prevalent in the current room rental market, where both tenants and owners face substantial challenges. Tenants endure time-consuming physical searches, fragmented information, and a lack of transparency, leading to a "room searching headache." Owners, conversely, struggle with managing a chaotic influx of unverified calls and a non-systematized listing process, resulting in a "room listing headache."

Existing solutions, often manual or inadequate online classifieds, fail to offer the necessary scale, structured information, and integrated features to build trust and streamline the rental journey. RoomEase's timely introduction aims to centralize and optimize this fragmented process, providing an intuitive, secure, and efficient digital marketplace for room rentals.
